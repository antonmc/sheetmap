Example of creating a map from a Google Spreadsheet

This was a learning experiment that I thought I would share. It uses a Google Spreadsheet, together with TableTop.js to read lat/long data into a Google Map.

In this case it was to plot the cardinals of the conclave on to a map, but you could follow the same pattern to plot any lat/long data from a spreadsheet.

You can see a working version of it here: http://goo.gl/o2bsy where there are links to other apis

And you can read my blog entry here: where!?
